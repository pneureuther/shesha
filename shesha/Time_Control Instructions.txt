                   INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE "TIME CONTROL" UTILITY OF COMPASS
################################################################################################

"Time Control" introduces time oversampling to COMPASS simulations. With this capability it is
possible to examine e.g. the impact of temporal mirror behavior on the AO loop performance.

"Time Control" establishes a main- and sub-cycle scheme where every sub-cycle corresponds to a
ordinary COMPASS simulation step. The simulation results of several consecutive sub-cycles are
combined by "Time Control" to form one cumulated results which are the results of the main-
cycle. At the end of a main-cycle the cumulated results are provided to AO control algorithms 
which provide mirror-commands for the following sub-cycles up to the next main-cycle.

BEHAVIOUR AND REMARKS:

- REQUIRED python packages:
    * numpy
    * time
- If no setting-variables are set, then "Time Control" will NOT introduce time oversampling.
- The following setting-variables should be set manually:
    * os_dec
    * pyr_dec
    * elec_noise
    * noise (wfs parameter)
    * pyr_npts (wfs parameter, only for pyramid wfs)
- The following setting-variables may be set manually:
    * noise_seed
- The sub-cycle time is equal to COMPASS's ittime. The main-cycle time is equal to os_dec times
  COMPASS's ittime. With a properly set os_dec the main- and sub-cycle times are set 
  automatically.
- For pyramid sensors it is necessary to set pyr_npts (wfs parameter) to pyr_dec for avoiding
  segmentation faults on the GPU.
- Photon AND readout noise can be added to the wfs images. The photon noise is controlled via
  COMPASS's noise and the readout noise via Time Control's elec_noise and noise_seed. 
  Therefore, the following valid setting-combinations exist: 
    * no photon and readout noise == noise = -1, elec_noise = 0
    * photon noise without readout noise == noise = 0, elec_noise = 0
    * readout noise without photon noise == noise = -1, elec_noise > 0
    * photon and readout noise == noise = 0, elec_noise > 0
- The variable wfs_images is a list of matrices, in which every matrix holds the cumulated 
  image since the last main-cycle of one wavefront sensor.
- The variable ctrl_cmds is a list of matrices, in which every matrix holds the commands for
  on mirror until next main-cycle. The matrices are structured as follows:
    * 1st row of matrix = cmd for 1st sub-cycle after main-cycle
    * 2nd row of matrix = cmd for 2nd sub-cycle after main-cycle
    * k-th row of matrix = cmd for k-th sub-cycle after main-cycle
- The variables flux_per_sub and halfxy are only computed to accelerate the execution of
  COMPASS. Both variables are used and documented in SHESHA.
- This utility only works for
    * terminal-based COMPASS calls
    * simulations with fixed and finite number of loop iterations
    * simulations with ONE call of simulator.loop
- Program flow (for os_dec = 4):
    it_index = iteration index in simulator.loop()
